# jello67.github.io.gallery
My project is gallery! I made my project to share some images I like which serve as inspo for my photography and to learn how to properly style images which I struggled on in previous projects. I made my project using HTML and CSS. I incorporated images and styled them to be able to be clicked on. I struggled with implementing some of the functionality such as being able to style the images properly so they render properly on the webpage and act as I wanted to. It was time consuming getting the animations right and other elements. I learned how to incorporate music elements.
